# Systray

## Overview

The systray is the zone on the right of the navbar that contains various small
components (called _systray items_). These components usually display some sort
of information (like the number of unread messages), notifications and/or let the
user interact with them.

## Systray items

A systray item is an object with the following properties:

- `name (string)`: an unique string describing the systray item (technical name,
  usually prefixed by the current module name)
- `Component`: the Component class that will be used to display the item. Its root
  node has to be a `<li>` tag!
- `sequence (number, optional)`: if given, this number will be used to order the
  items.

Warning: the root node need to be a `<li>` tag. Otherwise, the systray item will
not be styled properly.

## Adding a systray item

Once a systray item is defined, adding it to the web client is only a matter of
registering it to the systray registry.

For example:

```js
class MySystrayItem extends Component {
  // some component ...
}

const item = {
  name: "myaddon.some_description",
  Component: MySystrayItem,
};

systrayRegistry.add(item.name, Component);
```
